# SocioEconomic-Analysis-of-Developing-Countries

### Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of various indicators across multiple countries over time. Users can explore different metrics, visualize relationships between them, and gain insights into trends and patterns in data.

### Navigation
The dashboard consists of three main views:

* Country View
* Stats View
* Sandbox Mode

### Setup Instructions:

* Download the working_df.csv and the midterm.py files.
* Open your command prompt, navigate to the folder where you have the downloaded files
* Use the command `streamlit run midterm.py`. Rest is magic. :)


If you want to use the original work on how we reached working_df, additional analyses, imputations etc. - feel free to download midterm.ipynb and run the cells to see my thought process :)
